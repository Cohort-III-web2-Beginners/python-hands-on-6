# Python Functions Tasks â€“ Intermediate Hands-On 1

## Overview
This collection contains **5 hands-on Python tasks** designed for intermediate learners focusing on **functions** with combined use of **dictionaries, lists, loops, and conditionals**.  

Each task presents a **real-life inspired scenario** (such as hospitals, banks, quizzes, and voting systems) to help learners apply Python functions in practical ways while strengthening logical problem-solving skills.  

These tasks emphasize:
- Defining and calling **functions**  
- Using `return` effectively  
- Iterating with **loops** over lists and dictionaries  
- Applying **if/elif/else** conditionals for decision-making  
- Managing data with **dictionaries and lists**  

Some tasks also introduce nested dictionaries to simulate **real-world structured data**.
